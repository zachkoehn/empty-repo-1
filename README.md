# empty-repo-1
This is the first of three empty repos used to create an empty organization.

We also have to add some changes, this one coming from the code in  my personal repo. Unfortunately this change does not get pushed automatically. So, I think the best option is to just say "hey, here is a link to the organization page where this repo will continue to be updated" 
<a href="https://github.com/empty-org-3/empty-repo-1-org">Link here.</a>
